# Go + HTMX Blog framework

## General

The general idea of this project is to allow the user to create simple HTML blog posts in the `html/pages/` directory. These blog posts will automatically be served to the end user on the index page. This project uses HTMX to simply and efficiently reduce the project to just one page that loads blog posts at the end users request.

This project is purely made as a learning excercise for me to get familiar with Go and HTMX.
